# UrbanTreeCanopy
Track Urban Tree Canopy with NAIP Imagery

The county of San Diego periodically funds LiDAR tree canopy data. However, this is done infrequently and is expensive. 

The goal of this framework is to train an algorithm to estimate the urban tree canopy using NAIP Imagery which comes out yearly. This will be a tracking tool
for the city's Climate Action Plan (CAP) and a way for the city to monitor protected trees.
